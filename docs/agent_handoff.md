# CMMess — Agent Handoff

> **Format: always-current. Updated every turn, not end-of-session.** This is the first thing every agent reads. It answers "where are we right now?" — keep it true.

## Read me first in any new session

Mandatory before responding to the human:

1. This file — state of play.
2. `docs/completed_development.md` *most-recent entries only* — what just shipped.
3. `docs/project_management.md` task table — live task status.
4. `docs/bug_log.md` — active bugs.
5. `docs/backlog.md` — prioritized "what's next" *(created when the first backlog item is queued; until then see `project_management.md` § Queued)*.

Then read what's relevant per the Tier-1/Tier-2 list in the project instructions, and the one authority doc for the area you're touching (`docs/authority-docs-by-area.md`).

## Current state

**Project bootstrap in progress — no product code yet.** The repo currently holds the workflow scaffolding (Layer A templates, Layer B2 scaffolds, checklists, agent-config templates) plus the CMMess instructions and user story. We are standing the workflow up, not building features.

**Landed this bootstrap:** all Layer B2 docs (`architecture-facts.md`, `authority-docs-by-area.md`, `contract-sync.md`) and all seven Layer A living docs; `CLAUDE.md` (root) and `.cursor/rules/qa-role.mdc`; the three checklists filled (spec-authoring, close-out, and packaging-preflight resolved as defer-TBD); a fresh CMMess `README.md`. The instructions mirror received three edits — add `api-contract.md` to Tier 2, repoint Rule 12 at `docs/contract-sync.md`, and repoint §3's review-agent config at `.cursor/rules/qa-role.mdc`. All kept docs were de-referenced from the soon-to-be-deleted scaffolds so nothing dangles.

**Scaffolding deleted; slot gate clean.** The template `layer-a/`, `layer-b2/`, `layer-b1-example/`, `agent-config/*.template.md`, `teaching/`, `diagrams/`, `INSTANTIATE.md`, and `SETUP.md` are removed. The slot gate returns only the three intentional ADOPT-IF markers (in `contract-sync.md`, `sub-agents.md`, `skills.md`) — the written-down "revisit when X" triggers, which stay.

**T-001 shipped and closed out (2026-07-22) — first full loop trip complete.** The backend skeleton is live: FastAPI `GET /health` through a typed Pydantic model, one passing pytest, ruff+mypy strict clean, `docs/api-contract.md` seeded in the same commit (Rule 12), root `.gitignore`. Commit `0a3e2a2` on `main` (direct commit — tolerated once; branch→PR resumes at T-002 when CI exists). Dev → Cursor QA → PM read-verify → human runtime test all exercised for real. Full record: `docs/completed_development.md` § T-001. Backend venv lives at `backend/.venv` (`source .venv/bin/activate` before `uvicorn app.main:app`). Note: the PM is temporarily running as a Claude Code instance (Desktop MCP bug anthropics/claude-code#79971).

**Functional spec drafted + DEC-008 landed (2026-07-22).** `docs/functional-spec.md` is live as the product-behavior authority (announced in `authority-docs-by-area.md`): three WO origins (`uns_downtime`/`manual_downtime`/`manual` — Architect decision), manual asset registration with provenance + path-merge rule (DEC-008, narrows DEC-007 — the product is fully usable with zero UNS), standard WO state machine (Open→Planned→In Progress→Completed, +Cancelled), User self-serve execution on Open WOs. `architecture-facts.md` and `CLAUDE.md` were synced to DEC-008 in the same pass. **Awaiting the Architect's pass on the FS's [default] markers and § 9 open questions (FS-Q1–Q8)** — defaults are workable, so this doesn't block T-002. The three earlier constitution edits are synced into the Project instructions field (done 2026-07-22). Temp file `docs/architecture-diagram-temp.md` exists for the human to pull out — not a living doc; delete on request (its "UNS authoritative" label predates DEC-008).

**T-002 shipped, merged, fully closed (2026-07-22).** Renderer shell (Electron+Vite+React, main lifecycle-only, ctx isolation on) + `ci.yml` merged to `main` via PR #1 (squash `84761ff`); branch deleted local+remote. First complete branch→PR→CI-green→merge trip. The full loop ran with two real arbitrations: Cursor's doc-allowlist FAIL (PM branch bookkeeping, not agent drift — future ACs now say "the *coding agent* changes no files outside this list") and a first-run CI failure that produced **TRAP-001** (npm-major skew: lock written by npm 11, rejected by npm 10; fixed by repinning CI Node 22→26 to match the lead's machine and regenerating the lock from scratch — plain `npm install` was a no-op on the bad lock). Full record: `docs/completed_development.md` § T-002.

**FS settled (2026-07-22).** The Architect's pass on `docs/functional-spec.md` is complete: FS-Q1–Q8 ruled, all [default] markers accepted, decisions baked into the doc (§ 9 is the decision record). Headline rulings: one ongoing downtime event per asset; each event seeds its own WO; Planner ⊇ User; cancel Planner-only with an executor abandon path; seeded config accounts; 3-level priority; retire-not-delete assets; and **FS-Q8 override — v1 publishes WO lifecycle state to a CMMess-owned UNS topic branch** (backend stays sole MQTT client; fire-and-forget, never blocks the WO lifecycle; expands `docs/uns-contract.md` scope to a publish surface when authored).

**Session decision (2026-07-22): dev happens directly on `main` for the rest of this session** — Architect's call, workflow §8 conscious skip. CI runs post-hoc on each push; the discipline is to watch the push's CI run before starting the next task. Branch→PR resumes when the Architect says so.

**T-003 shipped and closed out (2026-07-22).** Persistence base live (commit `4a5a651` on `main`): five typed models, dual-engine Alembic initial migration, FS-Q1 partial unique index + origin↔event pairing CHECK both DB-enforced and test-proven, `docs/data-model.md` authored same commit (Rule 12; authority index updated to *live*). Agent verified against real Postgres 16 (Docker) beyond the env-gated skip. Cursor QA PASS (5 passed/1 visible skip). Known non-blocking: `test_models` fixture uses a raw engine without the SQLite FK pragma — fine for its constraint proofs, but any future FK-violation test must use the `app.db` engine path. Postgres-in-CI still deliberately deferred (`CMMESS_TEST_POSTGRES_URL` activates the leg). Full record: `docs/completed_development.md` § T-003.

**T-003 CI green on `main` (run 29937301125)** — the pinned Python 3.12 executed the full suite, closing the local-3.14 gap. Benign CI annotation noted for later housekeeping: GitHub deprecation warnings on `actions/checkout@v4`/`setup-node@v4`/`setup-python@v5` — bump action versions in the next CI-touching task.

**T-004 shipped, verified live, closed out (2026-07-22).** Auth is real on `main` (commit `04941a4`): seeded TOML accounts with revocation semantics, opaque sessions (SHA-256 at rest), and `require_user`/`require_planner` as the binding DEC-005 pattern (Planner ⊇ User) — recorded in `docs/api-contract.md` § Auth. Runtime-verified against the human's live `uvicorn` + dev DB (login/me/logout, identical no-enumeration 401s, revocation on logout). The dev DB is now migrated to head `0002` and the human's real `backend/config/users.toml` exists (gitignored, example passwords — **replace before any non-toy use**). Full record: `docs/completed_development.md` § T-004. Note: `docs/dev-history-temp.md` is an untracked temp file of the human's — leave uncommitted; delete on request.

**T-004 CI green on `main` (2026-07-22).** **Ordering decided (Architect): backend domain endpoints before the renderer login.** Planned backend slices, in order: **T-005 Assets API** (registry list/browse/detail with derived up-down status, manual register/edit/retire — FS §3) → **T-006 Downtime events + WO seeding** (report down / mark up, FS-Q1 service-level rejection, the event→WO seeding core — FS §4) → **T-007 Work-order API** (list/filter/detail/create, state machine with role-gated transitions + audit rows + abandon, planning — FS §§5–6). Renderer login + typed API client follows, against a stable API. UNS ingestion/publishing and packaging remain after that.

**T-005 shipped and closed out (2026-07-22).** Assets API live on `main` (commit `22f7608`): five endpoints in `backend/app/assets.py` behind a router-level `require_user` (the new precedent for domain routers), derived status/durations computed at read time, DEC-008 manual-only edit/retire with 409s, path immutability structural (`AssetUpdate` has no `path` + `extra="forbid"`). Cursor QA PASS; runtime testing was **delegated to the PM by the Architect this task** — 12-check CL suite against a scratch-DB uvicorn (port 8123, scratchpad DB; dev DB untouched) passed in full. `docs/api-contract.md` § Assets landed same commit. Full record: `docs/completed_development.md` § T-005. **Session sprint in progress: Architect wants T-005→T-008 (initial UI) done this session.** T-006 and T-007 specs are pre-authored and in the tree (`docs/tasks/`); five PM defaults inside them are flagged for Architect rulings (executor rule = start sets `assigned_to`; no backdating; retired assets reject new activity; end-event not idempotent; post-creation priority is Planner-only via `plan`) — defaults are workable, none block.

## Immediate next steps

1. Dev: **T-006 — Downtime API + WO seeding** (spec: `docs/tasks/task_T-006_downtime-wo-seeding.md`; command handed 2026-07-22). Then T-007 (spec ready), then PM specs T-008 (renderer login + typed client + initial UI).
2. Loop as established: Dev on `main` → Cursor QA → PM read-verify → runtime test (PM-delegated this session) → close-out → push → watch CI.

## Architecture authorities by area (read the one you're touching)

The full index is in `docs/authority-docs-by-area.md`. Short version: architecture constraints → `architecture-facts.md` (every spec) · product behavior → `functional-spec.md` · persistence → `data-model.md` *(live)* · REST boundary → `api-contract.md` *(live)* · UNS/MQTT → `uns-contract.md` *(to author)* · boundary-change sync → `contract-sync.md` · auth/roles → `architecture-facts.md` § Security · UI → `design-guide.md` · packaging → `packaging.md` *(to author)*.

## Standing notes

- **Keep the instructions mirror in sync.** Canonical project instructions live in the Claude Project field; the git-tracked mirror is `docs/claude_project_instructions.md`. When the instructions change, rewrite the mirror in the same turn. If the two diverge, the Project copy wins. *(As of this bootstrap, two edits — the `api-contract.md` Tier-2 addition and the Rule 12 repoint — were made to the mirror and need mirroring into the Project field.)*
- **No repo doc is attached to the Claude Project.** Every living doc is read on demand from the repo so it can't go stale.
- **The four foundational architecture choices** (separate-service topology, server-side role enforcement, SQLAlchemy+Alembic dual-engine persistence, live-broker UNS) are recorded in `decision-log.md` as DEC-004–007 and enforced via `architecture-facts.md`. Don't relitigate from memory.
